1. Introduction
Stroke, a major neurological disorder caused by cerebrovascu-
lar complications, is a leading cause of disability and death

worldwide. It ranks as the fourth leading cause of death among
women and thefifth among men [1, 2]. Globally, stroke-
related mortality rates range from 250 to 400 per 100,
individuals [3]. Beyond mortality, the more profound impact

of stroke lies in the long-term disabilities it causes, including
motor deficits, cognitive decline, mood disorders, and an
increased risk of complications such as rehospitalization and
falls. These sequelae substantially reduce the quality of life
and life expectancy of stroke survivors [4].
Among the poststroke complications, cognitive impair-
ments and mood disorders such as poststroke depression
(PSD) are particularly prevalent and debilitating. Cognitive
deficits may affect memory, attention, executive functions,
and concentration [5], while PSD—affecting over 30% of
stroke patients in thefirst year—significantly worsens overall
functional outcomes and increases mortality risk [6–9].
Given the profound impact of these complications on recov-
ery, effective interventions targeting both cognitive deficits
and mood disorders are essential for improving stroke reha-
bilitation outcomes.
Traditional treatments for PSD, such as pharmacother-
apy and psychotherapy, often have limited efficacy and come
with potential side effects [10, 11]. As a result, there is a
growing interest in alternative therapeutic approaches that
can enhance both cognitive function and mood without sig-
nificant adverse effects [12, 13]. Two promising interven-
tions are mindfulness-based interventions and transcranial
direct current stimulation (tDCS) [14, 15]. While these ther-
apies have shown potential benefits for mood and cognitive
function in other populations, their specificeffects in stroke
survivors remain underexplored [16].
Mindfulness, the practice of maintaining conscious
awareness of the present moment, has demonstrated efficacy
in enhancing memory, attention, executive function, and
processing speed [17]. Furthermore, mindfulness-based
therapies, including meditation and yoga, have been
reported to contribute positively to stroke rehabilitation
[18]. Mindfulness-based interventions operate through
mechanisms of focused attention, emotional regulation,
and increased awareness of present-moment experiences,
which have been shown to enhance functional connectivity
in brain regions involved in attention, memory, and emo-
tional control, such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cin-
gulate cortex [19, 20]. These neural changes are thought to
contribute to improvements in both cognitive functioning
and mood regulation.
tDCS, in contrast, modulates cortical excitability by
delivering a low-intensity electrical current to specific areas
of the brain. Anodal stimulation typically increases neuronal
excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation decreases it. When
applied over the prefrontal cortex, tDCS can enhance neuro-
plasticity and facilitate synaptic efficiency in networks related
to executive function, attention, and memory [21, 22]. This
neuromodulatory effect may support recovery in cognitive
and emotional domains in various clinical populations [23].
Several clinical trials have indicated that anodal tDCS over
the prefrontal cortex may enhance cognitive recovery in stroke
patients [24].
Despite these promisingfindings, there is limited research
directly comparing the effects of mindfulness and tDCS on
cognitive and emotional rehabilitation in stroke survivors.
Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of these
two interventions in addressing both cognitive impairments

and depression in stroke patients. By exploring these noninva-
sive and accessible treatment options, this research seeks to
provide insights into potential rehabilitation strategies that
could improve the quality of life for stroke survivors.
2. Methods
This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted
from July 2021 to July 2022 at Imam Reza Hospital, Tabriz,
on stroke patients who met the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The study was conducted during the second wave
of the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure participant and staff
safety, all sessions were conducted in compliance with local
and institutional COVID-19 guidelines. These included
mask-wearing, hand hygiene protocols, physical distancing,
and regular disinfection of equipment and surfaces. Addition-
ally, participants and staffwere screened for COVID-19 symp-
toms prior to each session, and vaccination status was
recorded when available.
The study is aimed at assessing the efficacy of
mindfulness-based interventions and tDCS on cognitive
enhancement and depression alleviation among stroke sur-
vivors. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three
groups: mindfulness, tDCS, or control. Randomization was
performed using a computer-generated random sequence,
prepared in advance by an independent statistician not
involved in participant recruitment or assessment. Alloca-
tion concealment was ensured using sequentially numbered,
sealed, opaque envelopes; these envelopes were opened only
after the participant’s enrollment to determine assignment
to the mindfulness, tDCS, or control group.
Blinding of the participants and experts was not possible
due to the nature of the interventions. Inclusion criteria for
the study included unilateral brain lesions, a minimum of
3 months since stroke onset, age between 30 and 75, ability
to attend follow-up visits, and literacy. Exclusion criteria
included refusal to provide informed consent, speech-
related left hemisphere lesions, a history of multiple strokes,
or pre-existing psychiatric illness.
A formal sample size calculation was not performed
prior to the study due to its pilot nature and limited eligible
patient pool during the recruitment period. The sample size
was based on the number of participants who met the inclu-
sion criteria and consented to participate during the study
period. Thefindings from this trial will inform sample size
calculations for future, larger-scale studies.
2.1. Interventions.All study participants continued to receive
routine standard medical care for stroke as prescribed by
their treating physicians, which could include antihyperten-
sives, antiplatelet agents, statins, and other medications in
accordance with clinical guidelines. However, no participant
received pharmacological treatment specifically for depres-
sion or cognitive impairment during the study period.
Participants in the mindfulness group received mindful-
ness training based on Kabat–Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. This program consisted
of eight weekly sessions, each lasting 2.5 h. The sessions were

led by certified experts with a minimum of 10 years of expe-
rience in mindfulness practice.
tDCS was administered using the Oasis Pro device
(Mind Alive Inc., Canada). For the tDCS group, anodal
tDCS was applied to the left lateral prefrontal cortex (F3),
with cathodal stimulation on the right lateral forehead
(F4). The stimulation was administered at 2 mA for
20-min sessions applied 5 days/week on weekdays over
a 2-week period, for a total of 10 sessions. Participants in
the control group did not receive any additional interven-
tions during the study period.

2.2. Cognitive and Depression Measures.Cognitive function was
assessed using the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III
(ACE-III), which evaluates attention and orientation, memory,
fluency, language, and visuospatial abilities. This assessment
was conducted both before and after the intervention phase to
measure any changes in cognitive performance [25]. Depres-
sion levels were measured using the Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II), a widely used instrument to gauge the
severity of depression, with scores ranging from mild to severe
[26]. Both cognitive and depression assessments were per-
formed pre- and postintervention to track the impact of the
interventions on participants’cognitive and emotional states.

2.3. Statistical Analysis.SPSS version 25 was used for data
analysis. Continuous variables, such as BDI-II and ACE-III
scores, are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
For within-group comparisons of pre- and postintervention
BDI-II and ACE-III scores, pairedt-tests were employed.
Changes in specific subdomains (orientation, memory,flu-
ency, language, and visuospatial abilities) were also analyzed
for each group.
Due to the relatively small sample sizes, we tested the
data for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk/Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Where data met the assumptions of normal
distribution and homogeneity of variances, parametric tests
were used. To compare the effects of interventions between
the control, mindfulness, and tDCS groups, one-way analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Post hoc analyses
followed where significant differences were found to deter-
mine between-group variations. Statistical significance was
set atp<0 05.
To provide clinically relevant effect estimates, we
calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and number
needed to harm (NNH) for each intervention compared to
the control group. A“clinically significant improvement”
was defined as a≥5-point increase in ACE-III total score
after intervention.
As individual participant response rates were not avail-
able, the proportion of participants estimated to achieve this
threshold in each group was calculated using the observed
group means and SDs, assuming a normal distribution.
The absolute risk reduction (ARR) was defined as the differ-
ence in these proportions between groups. NNT was calcu-
lated as the reciprocal of ARR (NNT = 1/ARR). NNH was
similarly calculated for any clinically significant worsening
or adverse outcomes; as no such events were recorded in
any group, NNH was not applicable in this sample.

3. Results
In this randomized clinical trial, 54 patients enrolled in the
study after checking for eligibility criteria among 89
candidates and were randomly assigned to three groups:
tDCS intervention (n=18), mindfulness-based intervention
(mindfullness;n=18), and control (n=18). All participants
in the tDCS and control groups received their allocated
intervention, while four participants in the mindfulness
group did not start the intervention. During the course of
the interventions, attrition occurred across all groups. In
the tDCS group, four participants discontinued the interven-
tion. In the mindfulness group,five participants discontin-
ued during the intervention after initially starting, resulting
in afinal sample offive completing the study. In the control
group, seven participants discontinued the intervention
phase. In total, data from 14 participants in the tDCS group,
5 in the mindfulness group, and 11 in the control group were
included in thefinal analysis.
In the mindfulness group, 80% were male, and 20% were
female. Similarly, males dominated the tDCS group with
85.7%, while the control group had 63.6% males and 36.4%
females. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the study
enrollment.
No serious adverse events were reported during the
course of the tDCS intervention. Mild and transient side
effects, such as mild scalp tingling and slight redness at the
electrode site, were reported by two participants but resolved
spontaneously without further intervention. No participants
withdrew from the study due to tDCS-related adverse effects.
3.1. Depression and Cognitive Function Before and After
Interventions.Table 1 shows the pre- and postintervention
comparison of BDI-II and ACE-III scores for each group.
None of the groups exhibited significant changes in
depression symptoms after the interventions. The control
group’s BDI-II scores slightly increased (p=0 66 ), the tDCS
group showed a mild reduction (p=0 76 ), and the mindful-
ness group remained unchanged (p=1 00 ).
Cognitive improvements were evident in the tDCS
group, with a significant increase in ACE-III scores from
63 57 ± 15 07 to 72 71 ± 11 35 (p=0 001 ). The mindfulness
group experienced a nonsignificant improvement, from
74 40 ± 19 29 to 77 00 ± 16 21 (p=0 42 ), while the control
group saw no substantial change (p=0 33 ). Figure 2 illus-
trates the distribution of ACE-III score changes across the
three groups.
3.2. Subdomain Comparisons.Each intervention’seffect on
specific cognitive subdomains was also assessed (Table 1).
Significant improvements were observed in the tDCS group
(p=0 01 ), while the mindfulness and control groups did not
show notable changes (p=0 52 andp=0 10 , respectively).
Although tDCS showed a tendency to improve memory
scores, this result was marginal (p=0 06 ). The mindfulness
group also showed nonsignificant memory gains (p=0 06 ),
while the control group experienced a slight reduction
(p=0 31 ).
Stroke Research and Treatment 3

The tDCS group had a significant improvement influ-
ency (p<0 001 ), unlike the mindfulness and control groups,
which showed no significant changes (p=1 00 andp=0 55 ,
respectively). Figure 3 shows the distribution offluency
score changes in each group. Finally, while tDCS improved
language scores (p=0 01 ), there were no notable changes
in visuospatial skills across all groups.

3.3. Between-Group Comparisons.According to Table 2, the
tDCS group demonstrated more substantial cognitive
improvements than the mindfulness and control groups.
ACE-III score changes were significantly higher in the tDCS
group ( 9 14 ± 8 24 ) compared to the control and mindful-
ness groups (p=0 02 ). The tDCS group also showed a nota-
ble improvement influency compared to the other groups
(p=0 04 ). Other domains, such as memory and visuospatial
abilities, did not show significant between-group differences.
Based on ACE-III change scores, we estimated that 69%
of tDCS group participants, 23% of control, and 36% of
mindfulness group achieved clinically significant cognitive
improvement (defined as≥5-point increase in ACE-III).
The calculated ARR for tDCS vs. control was 0.46, corre-
sponding to a NNT of 3. No patients in any group experi-

enced clinically significant worsening or adverse events;
therefore, the NNH could not be determined in this sample.
3.4. Gender Influence.Both male and female participants
showed similar responses to the interventions, except for
BDI-II and orientation changes in the tDCS group, which
differed significantly between male and female participants
(p=0 01 andp=0 006 , respectively).
4. Discussion
This randomized controlled trial is aimed at investigating
the effects of mindfulness-based interventions and tDCS on
cognitive enhancement and depression alleviation among
stroke survivors. Thefindings provide valuable insights into
the potential role of these interventions in poststroke
rehabilitation, particularly in addressing cognitive impair-
ments. While the effects on depression were minimal across
all groups, tDCS demonstrated a significant impact on cog-
nitive function, especially in the domains of orientation
andfluency.
The most notablefinding of this study was the signifi-
cant improvement in ACE-III scores among participants in

the tDCS group. The tDCS intervention led to a marked
increase in overall cognitive performance, particularly in
orientation andfluency subdomains. This aligns with previ-
ous research suggesting that tDCS, when applied to the pre-
frontal cortex, enhances cortical excitability and facilitates
neuroplasticity, which is critical for cognitive recovery
following stroke [27, 28]. The improvement influency is
particularly noteworthy, as this cognitive domain is often
challenging to recover poststroke due to the involvement
of complex linguistic and executive processes.
In this study, the NNT for tDCS versus the control group
was 3, suggesting high clinical utility; however, estimates are
based on a cutoffderived from distributional assumptions
due to a lack of individual-level response data. The signifi-
cant between-group differences in ACE-III score changes,
as demonstrated by the ANOVA, further support the effi-
cacy of tDCS in cognitive rehabilitation. Compared to the
control and mindfulness groups, participants in the tDCS
group experienced greater cognitive gains, particularly in
orientation, memory, andfluency. These results are consis-
tent with the growing body of literature suggesting that
tDCS can promote cognitive recovery by modulating brain
activity in regions associated with attention, memory, and
executive function [24, 29].
In contrast to tDCS, the mindfulness intervention did
not yield significant improvements in cognitive outcomes,

as indicated by the nonsignificant changes in ACE-III scores
and subdomains. Although mindfulness-based interventions
have been shown to enhance cognitive function in other
populations [30], the absence of significant improvements
in this study may be due to several factors. One possibility
is that the duration and intensity of the mindfulness
intervention, consisting of eight sessions, may not have been
sufficient to induce measurable changes in cognitive perfor-
mance among stroke survivors. Additionally, the mindful-
ness group was the smallest (n=5), which may have
limited the statistical power to detect significant changes.
Another factor could be the specific cognitive domains
affected by mindfulness. While mindfulness has been shown
to improve attention and executive function [31, 32], these
domains may not have been as severely impaired in the par-
ticipants or as responsive to the intervention as those tar-
geted by tDCS. Further research with larger sample sizes
and longer intervention periods is needed to fully explore
the potential cognitive benefits of mindfulness in stroke
rehabilitation.
Interestingly, neither tDCS nor mindfulness had a signif-
icant effect on depression symptoms, as measured by BDI-II.
Thisfinding contrasts with previous studies suggesting that
both tDCS and mindfulness can alleviate depressive symp-
toms [33, 34]. Several factors may explain this discrepancy.
First, the baseline BDI-II scores of participants in the

mindfulness group were relatively low ( 10 40 ± 8 01 ), which
may have created afloor effect, limiting the potential for fur-
ther reductions in depression scores. Second, the severity of
depression may not have been sufficiently high in the study

population to observe substantial changes following the
interventions.
Moreover, the relatively short duration of the interven-
tions, particularly mindfulness, may not have been sufficient

to produce meaningful changes in mood. While mindfulness-
based interventions have shown promise in improving mood
and emotional regulation in other populations, longer-term
interventions may be necessary to achieve similar effects in
stroke survivors.
The analysis of gender differences within the tDCS group
revealed no significant variation in response to the interven-
tion, either in cognitive outcomes or depression scores. Both
male and female participants exhibited similar patterns of
improvement, suggesting that gender did not modulate the
effectiveness of tDCS. Thisfinding is inconsistent with
previous research indicating that the benefits of tDCS are
influenced by gender [35, 36].

4.1. Study Limitations.This study has several limitations that
should be considered. First, the relatively small sample size,
particularly in the mindfulness group and also female partic-
ipants, may have limited the ability to detect significant dif-
ferences in cognitive and depression outcomes. However, in
order to alleviate the effect of inequality among female and
male participants, we looked at the gender differences, which
revealed no differences among the two genders. Additionally,
the small sample size in each group may affect the appropri-
ateness of parametric statistical tests due to potential violations
of normality assumptions. Although normality was assessed,
the power of such tests and the generalizability of thefindings
are constrained. Future studies should aim for larger sample
sizes to enable more robust statistical analyses. Second, the
lack of blinding in the study design, while difficult to achieve
in this context, may have introduced bias in the assessment
of outcomes. Third, the study duration may have been too
short to fully capture the long-term effects of mindfulness
and tDCS on cognitive and emotional recovery.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence that
tDCS can significantly enhance cognitive function, particu-
larly in orientation andfluency, among stroke survivors.
Mindfulness, while beneficial in other populations, did not
produce significant cognitive or mood improvements in this
trial, likely due to its shorter intervention period and smaller
sample size. Neither intervention significantly reduced
depression symptoms, indicating that further research is
needed to explore the optimal duration and combination
of therapies for addressing both cognitive and emotional
impairments poststroke.
