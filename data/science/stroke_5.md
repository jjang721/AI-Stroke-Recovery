Hypoxia after stroke: a review
of experimental and clinical evidence
Phillip Ferdinand1* and Christine Roffe^2
Abstract
Background: Hypoxia is a common occurrence following stroke and associated with poor clinical and functional
outcomes. Normal oxygen physiology is a finely controlled mechanism from the oxygenation of haemoglobin in the
pulmonary capillaries to its dissociation and delivery in the tissues. In no organ is this process more important than
the brain, which has a number of vascular adaptions to be able to cope with a certain threshold of hypoxia, beyond
which further disruption of oxygen delivery potentially leads to devastating consequences. Hypoxia following stroke
is common and is often attributed to pneumonia, aspiration and respiratory muscle dysfunction, with sleep apnoea
syndromes, pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure being less common but important treatable causes. As well as
treating the underlying cause, oxygen therapy is a vital element to correcting hypoxia, but excessive use can itself
cause molecular and clinical harm. As cerebral vascular occlusion completely obliterates oxygen delivery to its target
tissue, the use of supplemental oxygen, even when not hypoxic, would seem a reasonable solution to try and correct
this deficit, but to date randomised clinical trials have not shown benefit.
Conclusion: Whilst evidence for the use of supplemental oxygen therapy is currently lacking, it is vital to rapidly
identify and treat all causes of hypoxia in the acute stroke patient, as a failure to will lead to poorer clinical outcomes.
The full results of a large randomised trial looking at the use of supplemental oxygen therapy are currently pending.

Background
Hypoxia is common after stroke, and associated with
poor outcomes. In this article, we have reviewed the
physiology of oxygen transport, the cerebrovascular
response to hypoxia and pathophysiology, incidence and
aetiology behind hypoxia in stroke and its subsequent
clinical consequences. We have then reviewed all ran-
domised clinical trials looking at the use of supplemen-
tal oxygen therapy in acute stroke and made conclusions
regarding current evidence and recommendations for
clinical practice.

Oxygen physiology
The normal adult range of arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)
is 11.0–14.4 kPa and the normal range for arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) is 95–98% [1]. The term hypoxia refers

to oxygen levels below normal. It includes both tissue (e.g.
brain, myocardium) hypoxia and hypoxia in the blood
(hypoxaemia). Tissue hypoxia is defined by the concentra-
tion of oxygen in blood and also tissue perfusion, whilst
hypoxaemia is defined by the concentration of oxygen in
inspired air and its transfer into the blood [2].
Following inhalation oxygen is taken up in the lung
capillaries via diffusion down an oxygen concentra-
tion gradient across the alveoli [3, 4]. Oxygen binds to
the haemoglobin molecule, which can carry four oxy-
gen molecules; each binding and changing the shape of
the haemoglobin molecule and increasing its affinity for
oxygen [5]. A small amount of oxygen is also dissolved in
plasma. This proportion increases in hyperoxia, when all
haemoglobin is saturated [6]. Oxygen dissociates from
the haemoglobin molecule in the tissues owing to the
relatively hypercapnic and acidic environment (the Bohr
effect) [3].
Oxygen is a vital substrate that supports virtually all
metabolic processes. 90% of oxygen intake is engaged in

the cytochrome C oxidase system in the mitochondria [7]
generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as
the main energy substrate within cells. A continuous sup-
ply of oxygen is required to secure a continuous supply of
ATP maintaining sufficient energy for cerebral neuronal
and cellular activity. This facilitates an efficient energy
producing process making 38 molecules of ATP during
aerobic respiration, equivalent to 1270 joules (J) energy,
in comparison to two molecules of ATP (67 J of energy)
during anaerobic respiration [7, 8].

The anoxic brain
20% of all human oxygen consumption is utilised by the
brain [9]. The brain has no oxygen or glucose (the other
important substrate in the ATP producing equation)
stores. Thus complete disruption of cerebral blood flow
very rapidly results in an anoxic, hypoglycaemic state,
which via a variety of mechanisms ultimately leads to
cell death. Excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glu-
tamate, bind to a variety of receptors and allow for an
influx of calcium ions that help formulate the chemical
signal for depolarisation [10, 11]. Normally the re-uptake
of glutamate is an active energy-driven process. In the
absence of ATP this process fails, resulting in an extra-
cellular accumulation of glutamate, which continually
stimulates receptors leading to a persistent influx of cal-
cium ions [12]. Furthermore, the Na+/Ca2+ ATP driven
pump normally used to eliminate calcium fails, also due
to a lack of ATP [13]. The resultant high intracellular cal-
cium triggers multiple cascades that ultimately lead to
mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Furthermore,
instead of producing ATP, glial cells have been shown to
release ATP extracellularly [11]. Aside from rendering
this unusable by mitochondria, ATP also stimulates the
P2X7 receptor, which again leads to significant calcium
influx and ultimately cell death [13]. The other major
mechanism of cellular demise is via the formation of free
radicals facilitated by the reduction of iron from its fer-
ric (Fe3+) to its ferrous (Fe2+) form and the initiation of
inflammatory cascades [12].

Cerebral blood flow in hypoxia
In normoxic states, cerebral blood flow is very tightly
controlled by the partial pressure of carbon dioxide
(PaCO 2 ). Any hypocapnic state will result in vasocon-
striction and reduction in regional cerebral blood flow
and a hypercapnic state leads to the reverse with vasodil-
atation and an increase in cerebral blood flow. Cerebral
blood flow is somewhat less responsive to changes in
PaO 2 , which has the opposite effect to carbon dioxide;
a hypoxic state causing cerebral vasodilatation with the
aim of improving oxygen delivery and a hyperoxic state
causing vasoconstriction [14, 15].

In a hypoxic state, whilst the vasodilatory response
improves flow, the detection of hypoxia by peripheral
chemoreceptors will in turn lead to an increase in res-
piratory drive, increasing arterial oxygen content. How-
ever, the consequence of this is also an increase in the
clearance of carbon dioxide, which would theoretically
cause vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood flow
[9]. It appears there is a threshold to which the hypoxic
response predominates (and the carbon dioxide one
attenuated) at a PaO 2 of around 50–60  mmHg [9, 14].
Whilst the carbon dioxide mediated vascular response is
mediated via a direct change in vessel wall pH [15], the
oxygen response appears to be mediated by the deoxy-
genated erythrocyte via a number of mechanisms; which
include release of ATP and the subsequent actions of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase on the vessel wall,
reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide and the activity of
S-nitrosohaemoglobin [9].
The cerebral vascular response to hypoxia is not uni-
form. A study found that in an induced isocapnic hypoxic
state increases in cerebral blood flow were most promi-
nent in basal ganglia nuclei, the putamen, thalamus,
nucleus accumbens and pallidum [16]. Studies of blood
flow in individual vessels have found that flow in the
internal carotid artery is maintained during hypoxia and
that vertebral artery flow is increased [17]. This had led to
the hypothesis that blood flow is increased in this region
to preserve vital brainstem structures, or that possibly
the posterior circulation vasculature is less susceptible to
the effects of carbon dioxide for similar reasons.
Neurological effects of hypoxia
The neurological consequences of hypoxia are depend-
ent upon the speed of onset, the severity of hypoxia, and
the level of tissue perfusion. Rapid decreases in PaO 2 , as
in a cardiorespiratory arrest, can lead to permanent neu-
rological damage within minutes. However, lower, less
abrupt changes, can be tolerated if the decrease in oxygen
occurs in a gradual manner, such as ascending at altitude,
where individuals can acclimatise and develop tolerance
to lower oxygen partial pressures or, (to a lesser degree),
in chronic smokers. Initial clinical features include
altered judgement, difficulty in completing complex
tasks, and impairment in short term memory [18, 19],
but in the longer term deficits can be more widespread
and span physical and neuropsychological domains. Sei-
zures occur in up to a third of individuals within a day
of exposure to hypoxia, and are commonly partial com-
plex or myoclonic in nature. Intractable forms of either of
these types of seizure are associated with a poor progno-
sis [20]. Cognitive impairment domains include amnesia,
visuospatial deficits, frontal lobe symptoms, impairment
of executive function, and impairments in language [21].
These are covered in more detailed reviews on the sub-
ject [22, 23]. Involvement of the basal ganglia, a region
particularly susceptible to hypoxic injury, can result in
delayed Parkinsonism in older subjects, dystonia mainly
in younger people, choreo-athetosis, and tremors [20].
Varying degrees of unilateral or bilateral motor impair-
ment may be observed depending on both the anatomi-
cal level and extent of corticospinal tract involvement.
In very rare cases, the syndrome of delayed post-hypoxic
leukoencephalopathy may occur weeks after a seem-
ingly rapid recovery from the original insult. This condi-
tion is characterised by rapid deterioration in cognition,
emergence of extra-pyramidal signs, and loss of execu-
tive function as a results of severe demyelination [24].
The severity of leukoencephalopathy can be assessed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [20]. Electroenceph-
alography, somatosensory evoked potentials and MRI
can provide valuable information about the severity of
hypoxic injury, but also aid in prognostication together
with overall clinical state [25].

Hypoxia in the context of a stroke
There is no specific definition as to what constitutes
hypoxia in an acute stroke, and it is therefore reasonable
to assume that normal values for the general population
apply.
Sulter and colleagues [26] monitored 49 consecutive
patients who presented with an acute stroke within 12 h
duration using pulse oximetry for 48 h. Patients were con-
sidered hypoxic and treated with supplemental oxygen if
saturations were below 96% for more than 5 min. This
occurred in 63% [31] of patients, with 28 of those return-
ing to ‘normal’ oxygen saturations following administra-
tion of up to 5 L/min of oxygen. The remaining three
required much higher concentrations. Factors associated
with hypoxia in this group were stroke severity, presence
of dysphagia, and older age. Roffe et al. [27] recruited 118
patients (100 of whom had adequate measurements by
pulse oximetry) and found that the mean daytime awake
SO 2 was 94.5 ± 1.7% in stroke patients and 95.8 ± 1.7%
in healthy controls. Nocturnal saturations were reduced
to 93.5 ± 1.9% in the stroke group and 94.3 ± 1.9% in
controls. In the stroke group the average 4% oxygen
desaturation index (ODI) (number of times per hour
the saturation dipped more than 4% from baseline) was
higher than in controls. At night almost a quarter of the
stroke group had desaturations below 90%. The same
group also looked further at the differences between day
and night oxygen saturations [28]. In stroke patients who
were not hypoxic (defined as SaO 2 less than 90%) dur-
ing the day, baseline daytime saturations were measured
between 9am and 9pm and nocturnal saturation between
10pm and 6am. In total 40 patients were recruited and

in addition to SaO 2 , respiratory rate and sleep/awake-
ness was measured twice in each time period. The mean
respiratory rate day vs. night was 20 and 18 breaths per
minute respectively. The mean daytime SaO 2 was 95.5%
(87–98.6%) and 94.3% (80–98%) at night. There was a
strong correlation between respiratory rate, SaO 2 and the
4% ODI, making it clear that borderline daytime hypoxia
could predict nocturnal hypoxic episodes. Comparisons
in a later study were then made with matched controls
overnight [29]. In this study the mean nocturnal oxygen
saturations were found to be 0.5% less than controls,
with the lowest measured desaturation in this group of
79.4%, still almost 6% lower than the control group. The
largest difference was in the percentage of patients with
more than 10 desaturations per hour (42% stroke vs. 15%
controls). Hand et  al. [30] performed a study looking at
the feasibility of MRI as an imaging modality in hypera-
cute stroke assessment. One of the eligible 138 patients
for the study could not be scanned owing to pulmonary
oedema severe enough to cause considerable hypoxia.
For a variety of reasons it was only possible to consist-
ently measure oxygen saturations in 61 out of 85 patients.
In those in whom saturations could reliably be measured,
11 out of 61 developed hypoxia (lowest 74%) and of those
who received oxygen during the scan only two could be
monitored successfully. This highlights not only the prev-
alence of hypoxia in acute stroke, but the logistical dif-
ficulties acute hypoxia may pose for assessment. Another
study examined the effect of five different, but randomly
ordered body positions, each for 10  min on the impact
on oxygen saturation [31]. Interestingly, lying on the left
hand side reduced oxygen saturations, but only in those
who hand a right hemiparesis. Those who were able to sit
in a chair were able to achieve much higher mean SaO 2 ,
albeit suffering from more minor strokes. It was felt that
a severe stroke, with a right hemiparesis and underlying
chest disease were the greatest predictors of desatura-
tion, but only when lying on the left side. A subsequent
systematic review [32] comprising of three randomised
controlled trials (173 patients) and one case controlled
trial (10 patients) found that body position only played a
role in oxygen saturations if patients had underlying res-
piratory co-morbidities.
The risk of aspiration is well documented in acute
stroke (see below), but independent of this the ques-
tion as to whether feeding (oral or nasogastric) contrib-
utes to hypoxia has also been examined. Dutta et al. [33]
reported that nasogastric feeding caused no decrease in
SaO 2. A later study [34] found a small but statistically
non-significant trend towards hypoxia when tube fed, in
particular in patients that were fed overnight. Rowat and
colleagues looked at the impact of oral feeding on oxy-
gen saturations, using hospitalised elderly patients and
young healthy controls as comparators [35]. The baseline
SaO 2 was lower in the stroke cohort than the other two,
with a very small decrease in SaO 2 with oral feeding in
the stroke (0.1%) and the elderly groups. Nearly a quar-
ter of stroke patients dropped SaO 2 to less than 90% (16%
elderly, 0% young), but this did not occur in close relation
to the time of swallowing, and thus no immediate risk
could be attributed to oral feeding.
There is relatively little research on the correlation
between hypoxia and clinical outcome. Hypoxia has been
shown to be an independent clinical risk factor for post
stroke dementia [36]. Rowat et al. [37] found that hypoxic
patients were more likely to have respiratory disease and
this led to an increased mortality. A smaller study looked
at the prevalence of hypoxia in patients undergoing reha-
bilitation and found no significant difference in mean
SaO 2 at baseline, in nocturnal SaO 2 , the lowest noctur-
nal SaO 2 or in the 4% ODI [38]. In conclusion, no asso-
ciation between SaO 2 and functional outcome was found.
Hypoxia has, however, been shown to correlate with the
degree of white mater disease on MRI. White matter
hyperintensity volumes were greatest in obstructive sleep
apnoea (OSA) patients compared with non-OSA patients
and more explicitly in hypoxic compared to non-hypoxic
patients [39].

Causes of hypoxia in acute stroke
Pneumonia is a frequent complication of acute stroke.
A recent consensus defined the term stroke-associated
pneumonia (SAP) as a representation of a spectrum of
lower respiratory tract disorders occurring within 7 days
after the onset of stroke [40]. The criteria were based on a
modified version of the centre for disease control (CDC)
criteria, with a probable SAP fulfilling all CDC criteria
but not meeting typical chest radiography changes and
definite SAP fulfilling all CDC criteria including typical
chest X-ray changes. In addition the consensus group
concluded that there was a limited role for C-reactive
protein, white blood cell count and other inflammatory
biomarkers in the diagnosis [40]. A meta-analysis of 64
studies showed that the definition of stroke—associated
pneumonias varied widely [41].
The incidence of pneumonia post stroke has been
reported to range between 1 and 44% [42, 43] and has
been shown to increase mortality (threefold) and overall
hospital care costs [42]. Two recent studies have looked
at the utility of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce pneu-
monia. The STROKE-INF study [44] randomised patients
with acute stroke and dysphagia to 7 days of prophylac-
tic antibiotics (to be commenced within 48 h of stroke
onset) or standard care and found no reduction in the
incidence of pneumonia (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71–2.08,
p = 0.489). The PASS study [45] investigated the effects

of prophylactic ceftriaxone and found that this did not
affect functional outcome at 3  months. While there was
a significant reduction in infections overall, there was no
effect on the incidence of pneumonia (OR 0.67 95% CI
0.39–1.15, p =  0.18). Therefore, current evidence does
not support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent
pneumonia. There are several validated risk scores which
can help the clinician to identify patients at high risk of
stroke-associated pneumonia [46–48]. Given the con-
siderable morbidity and mortality, and the lack of ben-
efit from prophylactic treatment, highlighting patients
at high risk to allow early identification and treatment
of established infection is important in the care of stroke
patients.
Aspiration is a frequent cause of pneumonia post
stroke, especially in patients with dysphagia. Dysphagia is
seen in up to 50% of ischaemic strokes [49], although the
reported incidence can vary between studies. Individuals
suffering from dysphagia were three times more likely to
develop pneumonia and this number increased to eleven
times if they were shown to aspirate [50]. Often aspira-
tion occurs silently (reported in up to 40%), that is, with
few or no clinical signs. The presence of either dyspha-
gia or a subsequent pneumonia is predictors of a worse
clinical outcome [51]. An often neglected aspect of stroke
treatment is oral care. Poor oral hygiene leads to prolifer-
ation of bacteria and debris in the oral cavity [52], which
are liable to be aspirated causing respiratory tract infec-
tion [53]. This is particularly important in nasogastric
tube fed patients in whom oral care can easily be missed.
Sleep apnoea is a common cause of intermittent
nocturnal hypoxia after stroke, affecting up to 60% of
patients [54]. This condition has also been shown to be
a risk factor for future stroke and stroke mortality, if not
appropriately treated. A few small studies have shown
that nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ven-
tilation is feasible [55, 56], and can improve wellbeing in
some stroke patients with sleep apnoea during the acute
and rehabilitation phase, but compliance with the inter-
vention is poor, especially in patients with delirium or
cognitive impairment [57]. Obstructive sleep apnoea can
cause or accentuate many traditional vascular risk fac-
tors, in particular hypertension [58] and atrial fibrillation
[59], and has been shown to be an independent risk fac-
tor for stroke [54, 57, 60]. A review of the cohort of the
Wisconsin Sleep Study found a significant association
between sleep disordered breathing and stroke preva-
lence, the more severe the indices of sleep apnoea, the
greater the risk [61].
Respiratory muscle function is also a potential cause
of hypoxia either directly by associated muscle paralysis
or as a result of a secondary infection. Several studies
have shown (some in comparison to matched controls)
a significant reduction in forced vital capacity, forced
expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow
rate and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures
[62–64], suggesting impairment in function of accessory
respiratory muscles as well as the diaphragm. This may
pave the way for treatment strategies aiming to improve
respiratory muscle function [65].
Less common stroke complications resulting in hypoxia
include pulmonary embolism, which despite its low inci-
dence in most reported series (around 1%), is associ-
ated with increased in hospital mortality (31.5 vs 12.7%
in a review of over 11,000 patients in the Registry of the
Canadian Stroke Network), length of stay and severity of
disability [66]. The risk of pulmonary embolism can per-
sist for up to 4 weeks post stroke [67]. A review of a rela-
tively small cohort of cryptogenic stroke patients found
a significant incidence of silent pulmonary embolism
(37%), but did not comment as to whether or not this
led to a resultant hypoxic state [68]. Improvements in
mechanical, pharmacological and therapy based regimes
are the likely reason pulmonary embolism is now a rela-
tive rarity. Cardiac failure and very rarely neurogenic pul-
monary oedema [69, 70] are among the other causes.

Oxygen therapy for acute stroke
Oxygen treatment can be used to maintain normal oxy-
gen saturation or to increase the oxygen saturation above
normal in patients with acute stroke. The rationale for
the latter is that blood with higher oxygen content may
improve oxygen action in ischaemic brain areas [2].
When considering oxygen treatment it is important to
weigh up potential adverse effects against benefits.

Potential adverse effects of oxygen treatment after stroke
Oxygen treatment is not without side effects. Attach-
ment to a wall delivery system as an inpatient restricts
mobility in the acute phase and may represent an infec-
tion risk. In critical ill states or when bordering on the
anaerobic threshold for exercise capacity, the body has
several intrinsic systems to increase oxygen tension and
deliver oxygen at the required rate in order to produce
ATP and meet energy demands. One of the by-products
of ATP formation is the formation of oxygen free-radical
species, which, if not dealt with, can lead to cell apopto-
sis and developmental of tissue damage. In normal states
the body has several intrinsic enzymes to neutralise free
radicals by pairing them with so called donor electrons
to form substances like oxygen or hydrogen peroxide
which can then be efficiently removed. When high con-
centrations of oxygen are given this leads not only to
increased oxygen delivery from red blood cells but also
increased delivery via plasma. This then by-passes and
overrides usual mechanism of clearance and is one the

reasons tissue damage develops in inappropriately high
concentrations of oxygen [71–73]. The cascade outlined
above is only partially reversed during reperfusion, even
though oxygen delivery has improved. Most of the clini-
cal problems surrounding oxygen toxicity initially affect
the lungs. High concentrations of oxygen may displace
all nitrogen present in the alveoli and owing to the sig-
nificant alveolar plasma gradient, the oxygen rapidly dif-
fuses and dissolves into the plasma, effectively reducing
the alveolar volume and leading to subsequent collapse.
Hyperoxia may also impair mucilliary clearance and alter
surfactant properties which may cause an ‘adhesive col-
lapse’ [73, 74]. Neurological consequences outside of
those described in the context of stroke include cerebral
vasoconstriction, a by-product of excessive free radical
formation, confusion, and seizures [73]. Oxygen toxicity
more often occurs during use of high concentrations of
oxygen or in hyperbaric conditions. In the clinical setting
a stroke patient is exposed to, these are highly unlikely
scenarios to occur.
Recommendations from national and international stroke
guidelines
A review of the most recent societal guidelines shows
uniformity in the approach to oxygen therapy in acute
ischaemic stroke. The Royal College of Physicians
guidelines [75] advise use of supplemental oxygen only
if oxygen saturation drops below 95% and is not con-
traindicated, and recommends no supplemental oxygen
for saturations of 95% or above. The European Stroke
Organisation [76] advises supplemental oxygen use for
oxygen saturations of less than 95%. The American Heart
Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines
[77] advise that in the pre-hospital setting, oxygen sup-
plementation to maintain oxygen saturations above 94%
is reasonable and recommended for suspected stroke
patients and that on presentation to hospital satura-
tions should be continually monitored to watch out for
hypoxia. This guidance is based on the American Heart
Association post cardiac arrest guidelines [78] and thus
the same advice applies to stroke patients. Again the
guidelines do not support the use of hyperbaric oxygen
therapy.
Randomised controlled trials of supplemental oxygen
in acute stroke
A plausible solution to aid the correction of cerebral
hypoxia in stroke would be to provide supplemental
oxygen therapy in the acute phase, potentially helping
to correct or prevent many of the catastrophic cerebral
changes that may occur. To date 6 randomised controlled
trials have tested this hypothesis. A quasi-randomised
study of routine oxygen supplementation within the
first 24 h of acute stroke by Ronning and Guldvog [79]
showed that routine oxygen treatment (3 L/min for 24 h)
in unselected stroke patients did not reduce morbidity or
mortality. Subgroup analyses suggested worse outcomes
in patients with mild strokes treated with oxygen and a
trend towards better outcomes in severe strokes (Scan-
dinavian stroke scale score <40), but the study was not
large enough to identify with certainty those who are
likely to derive benefit. Oxygen saturation before or dur-
ing treatment was not reported and it is therefore impos-
sible to determine whether or not oxygen was ineffective
because it failed to improve oxygen saturation or because
of a genuine lack of effect on the ischaemic brain. A small
study (n = 16) delivered oxygen at a rate of 45 L/min for
8 h, commencing with 12 h of stroke onset. Perfusion-dif-
fusion mismatch on MRI showed that cerebral blood vol-
ume and blood flow within ischaemic regions improved
in the hyperoxia. Neurological deficit improved at 4 h
(during treatment), 24 h and at 1 week. By 24 h MRI of
the brain showed reperfusion and (asymptomatic) pete-
chial haemorrhages in 50% of hyperoxia treated patients
and 17% of controls (p = 0.06). No long-term clinical
benefit was seen at 3 months [80]. This study was too
small to draw reliable conclusions, leading to a larger
(unpublished) study by the same group (<http://www>.
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00414726?term=singha
l&rank=1) which initially planned to enrol 240 patients,
randomising to either room air or high flow oxygen (30–
45 L/min for 8 h) within 9 h of acute stroke onset. After
enrolment of 85 patients, the study was terminated early
due to an imbalance of deaths favouring the control arm,
though it is noted that the excess in mortality in the treat-
ment group was not considered related to the treatment
by an external blinded assessor. An Indian study [81]
enrolled 40 patients within 12 h of an acute anterior cir-
culation ischaemic stroke and a National Institute Stroke
Scale of more than 4 to receive either 10 L/min for 12 h
via face mask in the treatment group versus room air or
2 L/min to keep oxygen saturation above 95%. There was
no significant difference in NIHSS, modified Rankin or
Barthel index scores between the two groups. There was
also no statistically significant difference between DWI
lesion volumes in either group, though there was a trend
towards smaller lesions in the treatment group.
In the Stroke Oxygen Pilot study [82], oxygen was given
for 72 h and the dose was dependent on baseline oxygen
saturation (2 L/min if the saturation was >93%, 3 L/min
if the saturation was 93% or less). Initial results showed
that the treatment regime increased oxygen saturation
by about 2% in the treatment arm and this was associ-
ated with a small, but significant improvement in neu-
rological recovery at one week. At 6 months [83] there
was no statistically significant difference between the two

groups, although there remained a small trend towards
overall benefit with supplemental oxygen. This data led
to the Stroke Oxygen Study (SO 2 S) [84], in which 8003
patients within 24  h of hospital admission with acute
stroke were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either continu-
ous supplemental oxygen, supplemental oxygen only at
night (9pm–7am) oxygen, or no supplemental oxygen
treatment for 72 h. This study has completed recruitment
and is expected to report in 2016.
Conclusion
Oxygen is a vital substrate to the continual function and
survival of cerebral tissue. Rapid reduction in partial
pressures can very rapidly lead to catastrophic and per-
manent cerebral injury and physical disability. Whilst
evidence does not currently support the additional sup-
plementation of oxygen to stroke patients, it remains
important to prevent hypoxia in stroke patients by iden-
tifying and treating reversible causes rapidly. Results of
the Stroke Oxygen Study will provide new evidence of
whether prophylactic oxygen treatment can prevent neu-
rological deterioration and improve recovery.
