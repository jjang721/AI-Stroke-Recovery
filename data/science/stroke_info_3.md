Stroke: causes and
clinical features
Stephen JX Murphy

Abstract
Stroke is a clinically defined syndrome of acute, focal neurological
deficit attributed to vascular injury (infarction, haemorrhage) of the
central nervous system. Stroke is the second leading cause of death
and disability worldwide. Stroke is not a single disease but can be
caused by a wide range of risk factors, disease processes and mech-
anisms. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for
stroke, although its contribution differs for different subtypes. Most
(85%) strokes are ischaemic, predominantly caused by small vessel
arteriolosclerosis, cardioembolism and large artery athero-
thromboembolism. Ischaemic strokes in younger patients can result
from a different spectrum of causes such as extracranial dissection.
Approximately 15% of strokes worldwide are the result of intracerebral
haemorrhage, which can be deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellar
or lobar. Deep haemorrhages usually result from deep perforator (hy-
pertensive) arteriopathy (arteriolosclerosis), while lobar haemorrhages
are mainly caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy or arteriolosclero-
sis. A minority (about 20%) of intracerebral haemorrhages are caused
by macrovascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, caverno-
mas), venous sinus thrombosis or rarer causes; these are particularly
important in young patients (<50 years). Knowledge of vascular and ce-
rebral anatomy is important in localizing strokes and understanding their
mechanisms. This guides rational acute management, investigation, and
secondary prevention.

Epidemiology

Stroke is a huge and increasing global health challenge. World-
wide, stroke is the leading cause of acquired physical disability in
adults, and the second leading cause of mortality in middle-to
high-income countries. In such countries, the overall incidence

of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke has risen over the last
decade to 85e94 per 100,000, but is much higher (1151e 1216
per 100,000) in people>75 years old. Moreover, 85% of all
stroke deaths occur in low-income countries, which also account
for 87% of stroke-related disability-adjusted lifeeyears. In the
UK, stroke treatment and productivity-loss result in societal costs
of£8.9 billion a year, with care costs accounting for approxi-
mately 5% of total NHS costs. Cerebrovascular disease is the
leading cause of epilepsy in elderly individuals, and the second
most common cause of late-onset dementia.
Definitions
It is important to recognize that stroke and transient ischaemic
attack (TIA) are clinical syndromes and that the underlying
vascular brain injury can have many different mechanisms
(associated with different risk factors and disease processes;
Figure 1). Thus ‘stroke’ and ‘TIA’ are not single or complete di-
agnoses, but a starting point for rational investigation and
treatment.
Transient ischaemic attack and stroke:a TIA is traditionally
defined as a brief episode of focal neurological dysfunction not
associated with permanent cerebral infarction, and lastingless
than24 hours. Stroke is defined as focal neurological deficit of
sudden onset, with symptoms lastingmore than24 hours (or
resulting in death before 24 hours). These definitions are no
longer helpful in clinical practice for the following reasons:
treatment of stroke is time sensitive and needs to be commenced
as soon as possible after diagnosis; the 24-hour time boundary is
arbitrary; and 30e50% of patients with clinically-defined TIAs
Key points
C Stroke is a clinically defined syndrome of acute, focal neuro-
logical deficit attributed to vascular injury (infarction, hae-
morrhage) of the central nervous system; in modern clinical
practice, neuroimaging is increasingly used to confirm the
exact pattern of tissue injury
C Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for
stroke overall (though probably contributes to different ex-
tents depending on the stroke mechanism)
C Approximately 85% of strokes are ischaemic and are caused
by cerebral small vessel disease, cardioembolism and large
artery atherosclerosis-related thromboembolism
C About 15% of strokes are caused by intracerebral haemor-
rhage, which can be deep or lobar; 80% of these result from
cerebral small vessel diseases (deep perforator arteriopathy,
cerebral amyloid angiopathy)
C Stroke in adults<50 years old accounts for 15% of cases and
can result from a different spectrum of diverse causes
compared with older individuals, including extracranial
dissection

have evidence of brain ischaemia or infarction on diffusion-
weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Atypical attacks,
usually recurrent, stereotyped spreading paraesthesia and
numbness affecting the arm and face, are associated with con-
vexity subarachnoid haemorrhage, and therefore mandate brain
imaging, ideally with MRI. With the increasing availability of
MRI, it is likely that imaging-based definitions of TIA and stroke
will take precedence in the future. The term ‘cerebrovascular
accident’ or ‘CVA’ is outdated, inaccurate, encourages thera-
peutic nihilism, and should no longer be used.

Classification of stroke
The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST)
classification system is the most widely used mechanistic sub-
classification system for patients with cerebral ischaemia,
defining five subtypes: (1) large artery atherosclerosis, (2) car-
dioembolic, (3) small vessel occlusion, (4) stroke of other
determined aetiology, and (5) stroke of undetermined aetiology.^1
In the more recent phenotype-basedA-S-C-O system, every pa-
tient is classified according to the relative contribution of
Atherosclerosis, Small vessel disease, Cardiac source and Other
causes. The value of this additional complexity has not been
established in clinical practice.
There is less consensus on classifying spontaneous (non-
traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH; bleeding into the
brain substance). One system,SMASH-U, categorizes causes as
Structural vascular lesions, Medication, Amyloid angiopathy,
Systemic disease, Hypertension or Undetermined. However,
these categories are a mixture of risk factors, mechanisms and
disease processes; improved neuro-imaging of the underlying

causal arteriopathies would improve any future classification.
Other forms of intracranial bleeding (subdural, extradural, sub-
arachnoid) are not considered in this article.
Risk factors for stroke^2
Non-modifiable risk factors
Age:this is the most important contributor to stroke risk. The
incidence doubles for each decade after age 55 years.
Sex:because of the risks of pregnancy and oral contraceptive
use, premenopausal women have a stroke risk that is as high as
or higher than the risk in men. At older ages stroke rates are
slightly higher in men. Overall, more women than men have
strokes in the UK.
Ethnicity:African Caribbean individuals in the UK and USA have
twice the risk of incident stroke compared with their white
counterparts. In younger black adults the risk of ICH is twice that
of age-matched white people. This may in part relate to the
increased prevalence of stroke risk factors, such as uncontrolled
hypertension, obesity and diabetes, among African Caribbean
populations. Other ethnicity-related risks contributing to stroke
include carotid stenosis in white individuals, the metabolic
syndrome in South Asians and Pacific islanders, and increased
rates of intracranial stenosis and ICH in East Asian populations.
Genetics:in addition to the single-gene disorders that are asso-
ciated with stroke (CADASIL, CARASIL, Fabry’s disease, homo-
cystinuria, sickle cell disease, connective tissue disorders;Table

1 ), the MEGASTROKE consortium identified 32 genome-wide
significant loci, 22 of which were novel.^3 Some loci were
strongly linked to particular stroke mechanisms (e.g. large artery
disease, small artery disease, cardiac embolism), while half the
loci showed a shared genetic association with other vascular
pathologies, the largest correlation being for blood pressure.

Modifiable risk factors
Hypertension:this is the most important modifiable risk factor
overall for stroke. Approximately half of all stroke patients, and an
even greater proportion of those with ICH, have a history of hy-
pertension. Even among those not defined as hypertensive, the
higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk of stroke. This
makes the diagnosis and control of hypertension paramount for
primary and secondary prevention of strokes. The attributable risk
from hypertension declines after age 60 years, where it confers
relative risk of 3.5, to a non-significant contribution at age 80.

Diabetes mellitus:this is an independent risk factor for stroke,
associated with a 2-fold increased risk. Stroke accounts for 20%
of all deaths in people with diabetes.

Cardiac factors:cardioembolic infarction (mainly from atrial
fibrillation (AF)) is the most severe ischaemic stroke subtype,
with high disability and mortality. The presence of AF increases
with age, causing 20e25% of strokes in patients>80 years old.
Anticoagulation is extremely effective in preventing stroke in
people with AF (relative risk reduction about two-thirds).

Smoking:this doubles the risk of stroke. Smoking cessation
rapidly reduces the risk, with excess risk nearly disappearing 2
e4 years after stopping.

Hyperlipidaemia:the relationship between dyslipidaemia and
stroke is complex. There is an increased risk of ischaemic stroke
with increased total cholesterol, and a decreased risk of ischae-
mic stroke with elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In
contrast, total cholesterol is inversely associated with risk of ICH.
The use of statins in secondary prevention appears to reduce the
risk of ischaemic stroke (as well as functional outcome and
mortality) with no definite increase in the risk of intracerebral
haemorrhage. Current evidence and expert opinion favours of-
fering statins to survivors of ICH who have a strong indication for
their use (e.g. clinically relevant ischaemic heart disease).

Alcohol consumption and substance abuse:light and moderate
alcohol consumption (<4 units/day) has been reported to be
associated with a lower risk of ischaemic stroke, whereas higher
quantities are clearly associated with increased stroke risk.
Alcohol consumption has a linear relationship with ICH risk.
Recreational drugs including cocaine, heroin, amphetamines,
cannabis and ecstasy are associated with an increased risk of
stroke (both ischaemic stroke and ICH).

Obesity and sedentary behaviour:most of the effect of body
mass index on stroke risk is mediated by blood pressure,
cholesterol and glucose concentrations. People who are physi-
cally active have a lower risk of stroke and overall stroke mor-
tality than those who are inactive.

Inflammation:raised inflammatory biomarkers have a modest
association with increased risk of arteriosclerosis and stroke.
Infection can trigger stroke, and there is evidence that stroke
rates are lower in individuals vaccinated against influenza.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been linked to large vessel
occlusions in association with a hyperinflammatory and hyper-
coagulable state.
Pathogenesis of stroke
Stroke in the young:about 10e15% of all strokes occur in
adults aged 25e49 years.Table 1contains a list of stroke aeti-
ologies to consider in this population. Extracranial carotid or
vertebral dissection is common and important to consider but
should be actively sought through the history, examination and
neuro-imaging. Cardiac causes (e.g. patent foramen ovale,

thrombophilias are also important to seek in unexplained strokes
in younger people.

Ischaemic stroke:approximately 85% of strokes are ischaemic,
predominantly the result of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD),
cardioembolism and large artery disease (atheroscleroisis).

Cerebral small vessel disease:CSVD includes deep perforator
arteriopathy (also termed arteriolosclerosis or hypertensive
arteriopathy) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Deep
perforator arteriopathy affects the structure and function of small
vessels (usually in the range of hundreds of microns) supplying
the basal ganglia and brainstem; it causes approximately 25% of
ischaemic strokes, 80% of nontraumatic intracerebral haemor-
rhage, and contributes to about 45% of dementia (Figure 2a).
CAA affects small vessels but is considered separately as a more
important cause of ICH than ischaemic stroke (see below). CSVD
is diagnosed on the basis of radiological markers, including:
recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities,
lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces and
cerebral atrophy on MRI; or white matter hypodensities and

lacunes on computed tomography (CT). Its prevalence increases
with age with no differences between sexes, and can be higher in
Asian populations. The most important risk factor for CSVD is
hypertension. More rarely, genetic disorders (Table 1), radiation
exposure and immune-mediated vasculitides can cause CSVD.
Cardioembolic stroke:a further 25% of ischaemic strokes are
caused by cardioembolic disease (mainly AF), the risk increasing
with age. In stroke patients, paroxysmal AF is more prevalent
than persistent AF. Post-stroke AF is found in approximately 8%
of individuals presenting to A&E with a stroke, 11% of those
using 24e72-hour Holter monitoring and 17% of those using
external or implanted loop recording; however, the clinical sig-
nificance of short runs (<30 seconds) of AF is uncertain. Other
rarer causes of cardiac embolism are detailed inTable 1.
Large artery disease:stenosis or occlusion of the large cerebral
arteries (predominantly the extracranial carotid) is the cause of
about 20% of ischaemic strokes (seeFigure 2b). Rupture of
arteriosclerotic plaques leads toin situthrombus formation and
distal embolization. In addition, ruptured carotid plaques lead to

widespread platelet activation, and recurrent events are very
common, particularly in the first few weeks. Less commonly,
stenosis of the vertebrobasilar or intracranial arteries causes
ischaemic strokes. Haemodynamic strokes can occur when sys-
temic blood pressure drops in the context of arterial stenosis,
leading to infarction of border zone territories. Extracranial dis-
sections of cervico-cephalic arteries (sometimes traumatic) ac-
count for about 1 in 5 ischaemic strokes in patients<50 years
old.

Cryptogenic stroke:in 20e30% of patients with ischaemic
stroke, no cause is found. These strokes may relate to undiag-
nosed cardioembolic disease, hypercoagulable states, paradoxi-
cal emboli via a patent foramen ovale, sub-stenotic atheromatous
disease, non-atherosclerotic arteriopathies, occult recreational
drug use or undiagnosed genetic conditions or risks.

Intracerebral haemorrhage:spontaneous (non-traumatic) ICH
can be anatomically divided into deep and lobar (Figure 3). Deep
haemorrhages account for approximately two-thirds of ICH
cases, and occur in the basal ganglia and internal capsule (
e70%) or brainstem (5e10%). About 5e10% of ICHs are in the
cerebellum. The remainder are lobar haemorrhages located in
cortico-subcortical areas in the cerebral lobes, often near or
reaching the cerebral convexities. Hypertensive (deep perforator)
arteriopathy (CSVD) is the most important cause of deep ICH,
although it also contributes to lobar ICH. The term ‘hypertensive

intracerebral haemorrhage’ is unhelpful because hypertension is
neither necessary nor sufficient to cause most ICH. Detection of
the neuro-imaging markers of CSVD mentioned above (including
cerebral microbleeds) can help increase confidence that an ICH is
due to CSVD.
CAAea CSVD characterized by the presence of amyloid-b
protein within the cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel
wallseis an important cause of lobar (but not deep) ICH in
older people.^4 CAA is also associated with cognitive impair-
ment, transient focal neurological episodes (usually recurrent
stereotyped attacks of spreading paraesthesias affecting the
arm and face, often related to small convexity subarachnoid
haemorrhages). CAA can be diagnosed by brain imaging
showing haemorrhage restricted to the lobar brain regions
(Figure 3c).
After CSVD (which causes about 80% of all ICH), the next
most common cause of ICH is macrovascular abnormalities
(arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistula); these
are more common in (but are not limited to) younger people and
can only be identified by imaging of the brain vessels (e.g. using
CT angiography, MR angiography or digital-subtraction intra-
arterial angiography). Rarer causes of ICH include haemorrhagic
transformation of ischaemic infarcts, venous sinus thrombosis,
brain tumours, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome
and endocarditis (seeFigure 3). Recreational drug use (especially
cocaine) increasingly contributes to ICH in younger people.
Stroke localization
Knowledge of intracranial vascular territories and neuroana-
tomical pathways allows the localization of lesions with rele-
vance for interpreting brain imaging and understanding the
functional deficit, prognosis and mechanism of stroke (Table 2).
ICH cannot be reliably differentiated from ischaemic stroke
without imaging.
Anterior circulation:this comprises territories supplied by the
anterior and middle cerebral arteries, which are branches of the
internal carotid artery. The first branch of the internal carotid is
the ophthalmic artery. Carotid thrombo-embolic disease due to
carotid atherosclerosis can thus lead to ‘amaurosis fugax’ (tran-
sient monocular loss of vision) in the affected eye. A full prox-
imal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (often from a cardiac
embolus) typically causes contralateral hemiparesis and hemi-
sensory loss (seeFigure 2c), visual field defect, hemineglect and
(if in the dominant hemisphere) aphasia. Involvement of the
superior division of the middle cerebral artery produces contra-
lateral hemiplegia, hemisensory loss and, on the dominant side, a
non-fluent (Broca’s) aphasia. Involvement of the inferior division
often produces a contralateral hemianopia and, if left-sided, a
fluent (Wernicke’s) aphasia. If more distal branches are involved
the territory of neurological deficit becomes more limited (the
extreme of this being a ‘cortical hand’ syndrome due to infarction
of primary sensorimotor cortex).
Vertebrobasilar circulation:the right and left vertebral arteries
join to form the basilar artery, which divides to form the poste-
rior cerebral arteries. These supply the occipital cortex, so that
infarction leads to hemianopia. Strokes in the vertebrobasilar

territory are a diagnostic challenge because of the large number
of clinical syndromes they can present with (Table 2).^5 For
example, brainstem ischaemia can lead to ‘crossed’ signs, while
basilar ischaemia can result in bilateral hemiparesis, sensory
loss, visual disturbance and ‘locked-in’ syndrome.

Small vessel occlusions (small subcortical infarcts):Small
subcortical infarcts caused by occlusion of small perforating
arteries are probably often asymptomatic but when they occur
in eloquent brain areas produce ‘lacunar syndromes’. The most
common lacunar syndromes (and corresponding infarct loca-
tions) are pure motor stroke (posterior limb of the internal
capsule), pure sensory stroke (lateral thalamus), sensorimotor
stroke (thalamo-capsular region), dysarthriaeclumsy hand
syndrome (usually pons) and ataxic hemiparesis (posterior in-
ternal capsule, pons, centrum semiovale). The progression of
CSVD with accumulation of small subcortical infarcts and pro-
gressive white matter damage causes a typical clinical syn-
drome of progressive cognitive impairment (typically executive
dysfunction) and gait disturbance with reduced stride length

and falls. A
