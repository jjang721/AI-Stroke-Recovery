Abstract
Rehabilitation after hemiplegic stroke has typically relied on the training of patients in
compensatory strategies. The translation of neuroscientific research into care has led to new
approaches and renewed promise for better outcomes. Improved motor control can progress with
task-specific training incorporating increased use of proximal and distal movements during
intensive practice of real-world activities. Functional gains are incorrectly said to plateau by 3–
months. Many patients retain latent sensorimotor function that can be realised any time after
stroke with a pulse of goal-directed therapy. The amount of practice probably best determines
gains for a given level of residual movement ability. Clinicians should encourage patients to build
greater strength, speed, endurance, and precision of multijoint movements on tasks that increase
independence and enrich daily activity. Imaging tools may help clinicians determine the capacity
of residual networks to respond to a therapeutic approach and help establish optimal dose-response
curves for training. Promising adjunct approaches include practice with robotic devices or in a
virtual environment, electrical stimulation to increase cortical excitability during training, and
drugs to optimise molecular mechanisms for learning. Biological strategies for neural repair may
augment rehabilitation in the next decade.
Rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia after stroke has been limited for decades by a lack
of theory-driven strategies leading to successful clinical trials with improvement in motor
skills for daily activities. Recent therapeutic approaches have begun to build on methods to
manipulate the remarkable adaptability or plasticity of the brain in response to task-specific
practice, drugs, robotic trainers, and other ways to augment motor learning.^1 In this review, I
offer conceptual bases for a clinical science of neurorehabilitation and emphasise
mechanisms and procedures to improve walking and arm movement to lessen disability and
limitations in daily life. One goal is to diminish the pessimism of physicians regarding the
effect of additional rehabilitation and to provide them with sensible advice to offer patients
who seek to improve motor skills at any time after stroke.

The art of rehabilitation
Stroke is among the most common causes of adult-onset disability. 70–85% of first strokes
are accompanied by hemiplegia.^1 6 months after stroke, only 60% of people with
hemiparesis who need inpatient rehabilitation have achieved functional independence in
simple activities of daily living (ADL) such as toileting and walking short distances.2,
Patients with sensorimotor and visual-field loss are much more dependent on carers than
those with pure motor impairments, but even the latter may walk too slowly to participate in
out-of-home activities or may be unable to integrate the use of an affected arm into personal
care.
Rehabilitation for hemiplegic stroke includes organised multidisciplinary, supportive
services that begin 48 h after onset in stable patients. Inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation
works to the advantage of patients and families in a general sense, but the effectiveness of
each component of care falls short of evidence-based practice standards. The training of
patients to compensate with the unaffected arm or leg has been a mainstay of rehabilitation.
Physical, occupational, and speech therapists primarily build skills and change the
environment to maintain patients at home with as little carer support as possible. Problem-
solving, supportive social and psychological services, removal of architectural barriers to
mobility, braces and other orthotics, and devices such as wheelchairs and walkers continue
to play an important part in helping patients adapt to disability.
Well-designed clinical trials that deal with critical conceptual and therapeutic issues have
developed substantially only in the past 5–10 years.^4 As of 2002, about 125 clinical trials of
therapies for stroke rehabilitation had been designed as randomised trials with blinded
procedures for the measurement of outcomes.1,5,6 Most trials examined the organisation,
location, or intensity of general rehabilitation services, the prevention and management of
medical complications,1,7,8 and support for community reintegration; for example, organised
care in a stroke unit improves outcomes,^9 and home services may help prevent
deterioration.^10 Small pilot trials have also examined specific drug, cognitive, or physical
approaches to therapy, but their design prevents generalisation of results. Very few trials
have looked into the optimum intensity and duration of a specific intervention. Without
studies of dose-response interactions, interventions may be stopped before rehabilitations
gains peak.
Neuroscientific bases for rehabilitation
Within the past 12 years, empirical bases for rehabilitative practices have developed in
parallel to the growth of neuroscientific knowledge about basic mechanisms for motor
control, cognition, learning, and memory. This neurobiology of rehabilitation (panel 1) may
lead to improved methods for early and late therapeutic interventions to lessen physical and
cognitive impairments and functional disabilities.^11 A brief introduction to this rapidly
growing subject will help clinicians appreciate some of the elements that may increase or
limit gains.
The bases for the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of information in the healthy brain are
no different from those in patients with stroke, who have a lesser complement of intact

neural pathways. For example, long-term potentiation is one of the most likely molecular
mechanisms by which synapses and groups of neurons encode new information to represent
a movement skill (procedural memory) or retain information about facts and events
(declarative memory). Long-term potentiantion develops from repeated associated inputs,
called Hebbian synaptic learning, onto neurons in the motor cortex as they participate, for
example, in the coding of a new sequence of finger movements for playing the piano. Those
neurons, and others linked to them in related sensorimotor regions of the brain and spinal
cord, come to represent the acquired skilled movements. The same neurons participate in
other movements as well. Various neurotransmitters may excite or inhibit this learning. For
example, lorazepam may impair the acquisition of a new motor skill by activating the
GABA receptor, without interfering with the ability to do a previously learned task.^12
The neurobiology of rehabilitation-induced neural adaptations has developed from
experiments in animal models13–16 and from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies
in patients after focal brain lesions.^17 Early gains after stroke occur with the resolution of
oedema, ionic fluxes, inflammatory and oxidative processes, and impaired neurotransmitter
actions. In addition, residual tissue and genes like those expressed during brain development
serve as a potential substrate for reorganisation that may be modulated by rehabilitation
therapies.18–
Experience and training induce physiological and morphological plasticity after stroke
(panel 2).^1 Stronger synaptic connections arise between groups of neurons that represent
more skilled movement.^22 Cortical neurons discharge at different rates depending on the
direction, acceleration, and force of movement into space for reaching or stepping.^23 With
new demands and training, these neurons can represent different movements. Sensory
feedback, such as proprioception, has a crucial effect on motor ability at cortical and spinal
levels as it reshapes sensorimotor integration. Central controllers for movements interact
with the peripheral motor system and environment and use input from these interactions to
plan and modify a movement.24,
The capacity of spared networks and assemblies of neurons to contribute to partial
restoration of skilled behaviours is critical to improving the use of the affected arm or leg.
Functional neuroimaging studies show that the best gains after stroke generally coincide
with greater engagement of spared primary regions that ordinarily contribute to the control
of a behaviour.^26 Reorganisation also occurs within bilaterally distributed networks that are
normally only needed for complex activities. Homologous sensorimotor structures of the
uninjured hemisphere, for example, commonly develop a larger role. The brain's reward
systems within the basal ganglia,^27 tweaked by motivation and feedback, and its working
memory regions in the frontal lobe, become important contributors to the use of
informational cues provided by therapists to improve motor skills. Gains may also arise
from within subcomponents of hierarchical systems, such as the cortical and spinal
organisations for certain semiautomatic movements within the usual workspace of each limb
—such as stepping, reaching for a nearby object, or bringing the hand to the mouth for
feeding.28–

Clinicians, therefore, can take advantage of the injured brain's residual distributed system.
This resource for neurorestoration primarily deploys changes in synaptic plasticity in
response to motor learning. Well-defined training methods are essential for optimum
manipulation of rehabilitation-induced neural adaptations that produce behavioural gains.
Arm training
Forms of practice characterise all rehabilitation efforts to regain motor control. To some
degree, most approaches encourage the practice of feasible submovements and larger
sequences of action by varied means to target better multijoint movement patterns.
Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) progressively shapes more functionally
useful movements with an operant approach, coupled to simultaneous restraint of the
unaffected arm.^31 A standard set of tasks for reaching, grasping, and pinching are used. The
conceptual basis for CIMT is the idea that learned nonuse of the affected hand is common
after the completion of formal rehabilitation because of pain, slow and high-effort attempts
to use the arm, and ease of use of the unaffected arm. Forced use of the arm throughout the
day and formal training for 6 h a day for 2 weeks during CIMT are recommended, but less
intensity may work as well. Many patients make up to half their improvement in the first
several days of practice because they have substantial latent motor control. Treatment with
CIMT so far only seems beneficial if patients have a minimum of 10° of voluntary wrist and
finger extension; perhaps fewer than 10% of outpatients can benefit from this massed-
practice approach.
Forced use tends to negate other approaches for training, such as bimanual arm practice.^32
Also, published information on motor learning suggests that blocks of massed practice may
result in less need for memory retrieval over the course of training, which could lead to less
retention.^33 Spaced practice with some interval between sessions may lead to better
retention of a skill. A well-designed, multicentre trial of CIMT in patients with moderate
and more severe wrist and finger impairment 3–9 months after stroke will be reported this
year.^34
Some concern about massed practice in the first few days after stroke has been raised after
the experimental finding in rats that more neurons may be damaged or the size of the infarct
increased by early overuse of a paretic limb.35,36 However, the level of exercise of a rat
running on a rotating wheel is much greater than that a patient could possibly experience. In
general, exercise by rodents starting several days after an induced stroke and in healthy
rodents has positive effects on mechanisms of plasticity, such as production of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.^37 However, these results in caged inbred rats do not prove that this
exercise phenomenon occurs in human beings.
Task-oriented functional training customises therapy for repetitive practice of tasks by use
of whatever proximal and distal function is present. This approach uses motor learning
principles of spaced practice and intermittent feedback to facilitate real-world activities.
Tasks that are relevant to a patient's daily life, and hence are motivating, are done in random
order to optimise learning.^38 A pilot trial that compared conventional therapy for the arm
with functional task practice and strengthening for an additional 20 h during 4–6 weeks of

inpatient rehabilitation found both short and long-term gains in motor control for those who
received the more focused interventions.^39
Approaches for walking
One of the more common complaints from patients who are living at home 6 months after
stroke is that they cannot yet walk safely and efficiently in the community.^40 Walking-
related disability is common. The likelihood of recovering the ability to walk 150 foot (
m) without physical assistance depends, in part, on the type of stroke-related impairment
(table).^2 The Copenhagen study^41 showed that 80% of survivors of acute stroke who were
initially unable to walk reached their best function within 6 weeks and 95% within 11
weeks. Independent walking for 150 feet was achieved by 34% of survivors who were
dependent on admission and 60% of those who initially required assistance. Thus,
improvement on the basis of this common functional measure of walking, which is included
in the Barthel index and Functional Independence Measure, is maximum by 12 weeks after
stroke. By 12 weeks physical therapy has typically been stopped and 40% of patients who
return home are too disabled to walk.^40 Many people with ambulatory hemiparesis do not
walk safely. They have four times the risk of falls and ten times the risk of hip fractures of
healthy people. Just as importantly, these patients tend to walk at less than a half normal
casual walking speed and for only modest distances.
A study of 147 people 6 months after stroke revealed that those with hemiparesis who walk
at 25 cm/s (SD 10) achieve only household ambulation. Restricted community ambulation
generally required walking speeds of 40–79 cm/s. Unrestricted community ambulation was
most likely for those who walked at 80 cm/s (SD 15).40,42 Only 18% of people achieved
unlimited community ambulation. Across prospective observational studies and
interventional experiments, walking speeds at the end of inpatient rehabilitation range from
25–60 cm/s. Normal casual walking speed for healthy adults is 2·5–3·0 miles per hour (about
130 cm/s).^43 This functional limitation highlights the need for better solutions.
Task-oriented practice of walking
In research studies over the past 10 years, exercise and rehabilitation strategies to improve
mobility have become more task specific, intensive, and progressive in their demands.1,
When well-defined interventions to improve walking have been tested in selected groups of
patients in randomised clinical trials, gains are common for people who received progressive
interventions within 3 months of a stroke.44,45 Conventional physiotherapy—with or
without treadmill activities and of modest intensity—have also led to improved walking
skills, including level of independence and walking speed, when started 6–18 months after
stroke.46–53 Although patients who make large gains tend to be among those with more
modest impairments, these studies confirm the potential to improve function by trying a
pulse of goal-directed physical therapy at any time after stroke.
One approach for massed practice is treadmill training with partial support of body weight.
This strategy is developed from studies of cats with transected spinal cords,^54 but this
theoretical basis seems less translatable to humans than most reports suggest. Many postural
and automatic features of the neural control for quadrupedal walking are managed at the

level of the lumbar motor pools, which probably includes the conservation of a
subcomponent of the locomotor system called central pattern generators. This system
facilitates automatic reciprocal flexor and extensor stepping movements of the
hindlimbs.55,56 Remarkably, cats have been trained to walk on a moving treadmill belt with
trunk support after a low thoracic cord transection with their dorsal and ventral roots intact,
but they cannot walk over ground.^57 Human beings, however, probably depend less than
other mammals on pattern generation. Bipedal walking required a number of evolutionary
musculoskeletal adaptations and accompanying neural computations to manage human
locomotion.^58 For example, human beings must land on the heel and roll forward to the ball
of the foot to push off for greater energy efficiency; quadrupeds do not. Supraspinal motor
regions are quite active in human beings during over ground or treadmill walking as
revealed by functional imaging techniques.59,
Despite its theoretical basis, body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) has had a
disappointing effect on walking outcomes when compared with conventional training of the
same duration, at least in randomised clinical trials begun within 2 months of onset of
hemiplegia. In these trials during inpatient rehabilitation, patients were trained at slow
treadmill speeds (from 0·2–1·0 mph) and body-weight support was used only until patients
could step at slow speeds without assistance, rather than using support to enable practice at
faster speeds.45,61–64 Training at fast treadmill speeds leads to fast walking over ground.51,
Patients with hemiparesis can safely exercise at a level of effort that provides a conditioning
response.^47 The energy cost of walking may decrease by 50% as walking speeds increase
from 40 cm/s to 150 cm/s.^66
BWSTT may have a greater effect in patients with more chronic hemiparesis who walk with
a poor gait pattern and slowly (less than 80 cm/s) beyond the time usually allotted for
inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation.51,61,67 Important features of training include practice
at treadmill speeds consistently faster than the subject can walk over ground and physical
and verbal cues from therapists who help to optimise the symmetry of stepping, joint angles,
and timing of loading and unloading each leg by manipulating the legs and pelvis. No
randomised clinical trial has been done. A recent Cochrane review of 11 trials with a total of
458 participants concluded that a well-designed large-scale study to assess BWSTT after
stroke is urgently needed.^68
An approach such as BWSTT is not a stand-alone therapy. It must be complemented by
training on various surfaces that further help patients recapture motor control for a better
gait pattern, as well as by working on strengthening, conditioning, and balance. Physicians
can encourage patients to work on these features of walking. One simple technique to
rapidly improve the symmetry and speed of walking is to have the patient more consciously
try to push the leg that is in mid-stance into the floor and, at that moment, pull the other leg
from the hip to initiate its swing forward. This load and swing cue improves attention to the
timing of loading the stance leg (particularly the unaffected one) and swinging the other
(especially the affected leg). The strategy is supported by data from studies of sensory
triggers for rhythmic stepping in human beings and other mammals.69,

Spasticity
Clinicians may spend needless effort in trying to treat increases in muscle tone, despite the
fact that spasticity is not causing any fuctional disability. Clinically significant spasticity is
rather uncommon after stroke.^71 The loss of independent movements, such as hip flexion
and knee extension for walking or elbow extension for reaching with simultaneous wrist
extension (movement out of synergy), is commonly thought to be treatable by interventions
that decrease muscle tone. Impairment in making a reaching movement, such as raising the
hemiparetic arm to reach while extending the elbow, seems to reflect a problem in motor
control for isolation of individualised movements, not due to spasticity.^72 Muscle tone is
poorly related with functional disability. Indeed, bad motor control—as assessed by paresis,
impaired dexterity, and fatigability, along with tissue changes in muscle^73 —is usually more
limiting than increased tone.^1
Hypertonicity that leads to dystonic flexor postures of the hand and inversion of the foot is
perhaps most commonly caused by pain, overuse, and impaired postural control that drives
flexor or extensor activity. Immediate medical and rehabilitation management will prevent
dystonic postures. A brief course of antispasticity drugs may also help, but continued drug
use should be reassessed at least quarterly. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
dopamine blockers can sometimes increase hypertonicity, so they should be stopped.
Antispasticity drugs and locally injected botulinum toxin rarely improve function of the
arms. Studies that report efficacy for the hand and arm rely on scales that do not address
functional limitations.^74 Also, trials do not combine the intervention with range of motion,
weight bearing, and other rehabilitation interventions that may eliminate the need to
denervate a muscle every 3–4 months. Botulinum toxin injected into the tibialis posterior
and toe plantar flexors may improve the gait of patients with plantar flexion and inversion
that limits heel strike and stance, but must be followed by stretching and gait training.
How much training?
Many small trials reveal motor and behavioural improvements in patients with chronic
disability after a pulse of therapy aimed at a specific impairment or functional goal at any
time after a stroke (panel 3).51,61,65,75–82 An ethical challenge for the providers of therapies
is to find common agreement with patients about realistic functional and quality-of-life
goals. Clinicians should test adjunct strategies on patients who have at least modest motor
control before deciding that no further gains can be made.
The intensity and duration of therapy varies widely in studies. The decision about frequency
and duration of therapy is, in many cases, made entirely on the basis of what is practical for
patients and investigators in a research study or on the number of treatment sessions covered
by payments from a third party. Some general guidelines can be drawn. Most studies that led
to a very significant 10 point gain on the Fugl–Meyer motor assessment of selective
movements or greater strength provided specific treatment by a therapist for 12–60 h,
running from 1–6 h a day, 3–5 days a week for 2–12 weeks. Most likely, the amount of goal-
directed therapy, rather than the daily intensity, is the most important factor.^83 Many
outpatient clinical trials offer the experimental intervention for 1 h/day, 3 days a week for 2–

3 months.^44 We have found that task-specific functional therapy for the arm leads to
significant gains in motor control and strength if patients are allowed to continue treatment
until no further gains are made for up to ten additional sessions.^84 Within the context of
research studies, our laboratory routinely improves the walking speed of patients with
chronic hemiparesis by 30–50% with 3 h a week for 4–6 weeks of BWSTT or other
intensive practice, plus home practice. Continued training in 2–4 week increments improves
the gait pattern in many patients until a plateau is reached at 24–36 sessions (figure).^85 More
studies with open-ended length until a planned endpoint are needed.
Patients are more likely to improve if they practice tasks at home in convenient blocks of 20
min a few times a day. It is most motivating for them to select tasks they wish to add to their
daily activities, such as turning a key in a lock, reaching for cups and silverware until they
empty the shelf, pulling shirts on hangers from a rack, and typing with whichever fingers
function at increasing speed and accuracy. They can also repeat standing up from a chair and
sitting down three to five times each time they do have to get up to build thigh and gluteal
strength. Indeed, proximal weakness of the affected and unaffected hip and knee muscles is
common because patients are less active due to the hemiparesis, use a wheelchair for
outdoor mobility, or have side-effects of drugs—such as a statin-induced myopathy.
Strengthening exercises are possible. Clinical trials reveal efficacy without causing com-
plications, such as pain or spasticity.86–88 Weights, theraband elastic strips, and treadmill
walking or stationary bicycling allow training at home. The success of strengthening with
resistance exercises with weights for two sets of 12 repetitions against about 50% of the
maximum single repetition load requires three sessions a week for 8–12 weeks. Isometric
exercise against moderate resistance is a safe approach for patients who are frail and
cognitively impaired. Patients may improve their walking speed by timing themselves
walking 50 m several times a week, pushing to gradually accomplish this in 45 s while a
helper assists for safety if necessary. Physicians and family can also motivate patients to
gradually build their endurance for walking the distances necessary for community
activities, for example, by monitoring the distance walked in 10 min.
Functional neuroimaging in rehabilitation
The strength of the relations between therapeutic practice by patients with brain lesions,
mechanisms of activity-dependent plasticity, and changes in the brain maps of neuronal
activity acquired by techniques of functional imaging are not fully understood. More work
has gone into proving plasticity after stroke without a specific rehabilitation intervention
than into trying to extract the elements of training that induce plasticity in relation to
behavioural gains. In addition, very few studies have related important functional gains to
specific patterns of functional MRI activity.^26
Functional imaging, however, may offer clinicians insight into how to better engage a
network in the hope of improving rehabilitation training techniques. For example, the
magnitude of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in functional MRI studies is greater
within M1 and the supplementary motor cortex when the eyes gaze in the direction of the
hand doing a sequential motor task than when looking at the inactive hand. Activity within
the dorsal premotor cortex for the affected hand after stroke reveals its contribution as a

substrate of functional gains for use of the hand, bolstered by connections to visuomotor
regions.^89 Thus, focused visual input may be an important feature of training. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional MRI studies over the time of a treatment
strategy could take snapshots of a network, to ensure it was engaged by the intervention.
Imaging could also be done during a verbal or visuospatial working memory task to help
estimate a patient's residual neural resources for learning and potential to employ mental
imagery and observation of arm actions as forms of practice.90,
PET, functional MRI, and TMS^92 has detected functional reorganisation as a patient's
sensorimotor and cognitive experience was manipulated, primarily in studies of arm
recovery.26,93 For walking, near-infrared spectroscopy^94 during stepping on a treadmill and
functional MRI during ankle dorsiflexion (figure)85,95,96 serve as markers of training-
induced plasticity. Improved motor control of the leg and faster walking speed were
accompanied by recruitment of sensorimotor system neurons and representational changes.
Longitudinal functional MRI mapping studies may offer insight into the optimal intensity or
duration of a task-specific therapy.^85 Mapping of brain-activity patterns may also help to
predict the capacity of a movement representation to reorganise in response to a particular
therapy soon after the start of the intervention. For example, TMS of the hand representation
in M1 of the affected hemisphere reveals less excitability after stroke than stimulation of the
unaffected side. Increased excitability of affected M1 with greater symmetry between the
two sides in the first several sessions of task-oriented training of the hemiparetic arm was
associated with long-term gains in the Fugl–Meyer score for motor control.^84
Neuroaugmentation
Even with optimised approaches and intensities of physical, occupational, language, and
cognitive rehabilitation, other manipulations may be needed to increase gains. These
interventions require further study but build on growing research rationales.
Neuropharmacological adjuncts
Cascades of molecular interactions underlie activity-dependent plasticity and skills learning.
Many of these processes involve the major neurotransmitters.^97 After stroke, dopamine,
acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine may be interrupted or downregulated in their
projections to cortex from sites of origin in the brainstem. This may contribute to diaschisis,
the failure of transynaptic neurotransmission. Clinicians may soon identify individuals with
genotypes that also reduce central aminergic or cholinergic tone. These “low-aminergic”
patients may benefit, for example, from amphetamine after a brain injury.^98 Pertinent to
clinical practice is the possibility that commonly used drugs may change neurotransmitter
concentrations or block their receptors, leading to iatrogenic loss of tone. Stroke trials
suggest at least a transient decline in function from antiepileptic drugs (which affect
cognitive processing), dopamine blockers such as antipsychotics, and α 2 adrenergic drugs.^99
Augmentation of one of these chemical transmitters, especially activation of NMDA
receptors,^100 may drive long-term potentiation and optimise activity-dependent relearning of
skills after stroke. Available acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may aid both declarative and
procedural learning.16,101 Among their functions, acetylcholine projections from the nucleus

basalis transmit behaviourally relevant sensory information. Dopaminergic drugs such as
levodopa,^102 as well as drugs that increase the availability of norepinephrine, such as
methylphenidate^103 and amphetamine,104,105 have shown some efficacy in stroke-
rehabilitation trials when combined with physical or language therapy. Dopaminergic
projections from the ventral tegmental tract relate a reward to the cognitive effort of the task,
which reinforces associative learning. Norepinephrine projections from the locus coeruleus
also modulate the saliency of sensory inputs, attention, and features of memory.^106 Drugs
that act on these neurotransmitter receptors improve task-specific signalling.^107 Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors have modestly improved motor learning in healthy people and
patients with stroke for arm tasks, as the drugs increased regional brain activity.108,
Studies with TMS suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase the
excitability of corticospinal neurons.^110
Learning and synaptic plasticity are also modulated by other molecules, such as cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB), which can be activated by drugs.^111
Pharmaceutical research is very active in the development of “memory” drugs for
Alzheimer's disease that could also enable task-specific learning. The propensity for
responsiveness to a drug may be predicted by fMRI and PET activation studies^112 and by
TMS.113,114 These tools, then, may help clinicians choose a drug for an individualised
approach to augment rehabilitation.^115
Electrical neurostimulation
Motor gains and limited functional gains have been elicited by electrical neuromuscular
stimulation triggered by feedback. One approach stimulates a weak muscle, such as the wrist
extensors, on the basis of the amplitude of the electromyographic signal during attempted
voluntary movement of a joint.32,116 Other biofeedback techniques may help patients
activate a muscle or joint movement, although there are few data. Direct neuromuscular
electrical stimulation over the surface of key muscles for a grasp and pinch movement may
improve motor skills when combined with task-oriented practice.^117 Functional electrical
stimulation is also used to activate paretic muscles timed to a movement, such as contraction
of the tibialis anterior to clear the foot during the swing phase of walking. Injectable BION
electrodes triggered by an external transmitter have shown potential as a muscle-stimulating
neuroprosthesis.^118
Cortical plasticity has been modulated for up to several hours in animals and human beings
by peripheral-nerve and direct cortical stimulation, independently and in combination.^119
These methods include cortical motor stimulation by repetitive TMS,^120 direct electrode
array stimulation over the dura of M1,^121 repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation,^122 and
paired associative stimulation with a TMS pulse immediately after a peripheral nerve
stimulus.123,124 Mechanisms of action include an increase in NMDA excitation, a decrease
in GABA inhibition, an increase in neuronal excitability, and Hebbian associative synaptic
learning. In a similar vein, local anaesthesia of a portion of the affected hand rapidly
changed representational plasticity and improved function.^125 The inducing of anaesthesia in
the unaffected hand seemed to reverse inhibition of the unaffected hemisphere on the
affected side,^126 leading to transient gains in hand strength.^127 Practice combined with

carefully chosen stimulation may come into clinical use to augment short-term learning and
function.
Robotic trainers and virtual-reality practice
These adjuncts may maximise the intensity and convenience of task-oriented practice.
Computerised virtual reality-based activities have a reasonable conceptual basis for
rehabilitation.128–130 A virtual-reality system may include a computer or television screen
that shows the virtual environment, a device on the patient's hand that records movement
direction and acceleration as he or she reaches into cyberspace, and motivational games that
encourage reaching, grasping, and manipulation. People can watch and attempt to mimic a
movement that may activate a class of mirror neurons to drive visuomotor
neuroplasticity.^131 The investigator can give quantitative feedback about the accuracy and
speed of movement. A few small trials suggest possible effectiveness for these forms of
practice.^132
For reaching or walking, a range of clever automated assistive devices are in
development.^133 They may offer more intensive practice opportunities without increasing
time spent on supervision by the treating therapist. Robotic devices can also measure motor
skills, especially during movements of the whole limb. For the arm, devices have been
limited to shoulder and elbow movements. Results from small trials point more to improved
strength^79 than to improved function.134,135 For walking, a stepper device produced equal
results to conventional gait training in terms of walking speed.^136 Future trials of the devices
should seek better definition of the optimal intensity and duration of treatment.
Neural Repair
Animal models of stroke and spinal-cord injury reveal the potential for clinicians to
modulate similar acute and chronic responses for repair.^137 Biological interventions may
promote regeneration of cells, axons, and neural circuitry. Endogenous neurons and glia
from the subventricular zone near an infarct may proliferate and migrate toward the stroke in
response to local signals. Exogenous stem cells, neural progenitors, bone-marrow stromal
cells,^138 and other types^139 offer hope for restoration of cells and their proteins for repair.^140
These cells may bridge an injury site to enable greater connectivity. Stem cells and
engineered fibroblasts are readily engineered to make brain-derived neurotrophic factor and
acetylcholine, for example, which could allow placement of the growth factor or
neurotransmitter where needed. Pharmacological and immunological approaches may target
growth-cone receptors to provide signals for regeneration or to block inhibitory factors in
the environment.^141 However, incorporation of new neurons and axons that augment
functional recovery will also depend on rehabilitation therapies, especially those that drive
activity-dependent plasticity. Without such drives, these new elements and cortical and
subcortical projections may not become incorporated into learning networks.36,142,
Conclusions
Rehabilitation after stroke must continue to address serious functional limitations, such as
walking speed and distance that permit community activities and better use of a hemiparetic
